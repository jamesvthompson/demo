We will demonstrate privilege escalation using a vulnerable Linux system like Metasploitable. Metasploitable is an intentionally vulnerable Linux virtual machine, designed for testing and practicing penetration testing techniques. We'll be using the Metasploit Framework, a popular penetration testing tool, to exploit known vulnerabilities and gain elevated privileges.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up and perform the demonstration:

## 1. Set up Metasploitable:

Download Metasploitable from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3. Follow the instructions to build and set up the virtual machine on your preferred virtualization platform (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware).

## 2. Set up Metasploit:

Install the Metasploit Framework on your system, following the instructions from the official website: https://www.metasploit.com/. You can use a Linux system or even use Kali Linux, which comes pre-installed with Metasploit.

## 3. Identify the target:

Find the IP address of the Metasploitable virtual machine. You can do this by logging into the VM and running the "ifconfig" or "ip addr" command, depending on the Linux distribution.

## 4. Scan for vulnerabilities:

From your Metasploit system, run a vulnerability scan against the Metasploitable VM using a tool like Nmap. This will help you identify open ports and services.

```
nmap -sV -p- <Metasploitable_IP>
```

## 5. Select a vulnerability:

Based on the scan results, research known vulnerabilities for the identified services. For instance, you might find an outdated version of a service with a known privilege escalation exploit. You can also refer to the Metasploit Framework's database to find available exploits.

## 6. Exploit the vulnerability:

Launch the Metasploit console by running the following command:

```
msfconsole
```

Next, use the appropriate exploit module:

```
use exploit/<exploit_module_name>
```

Set the target's IP address:

```
set RHOSTS <Metasploitable_IP>
```

Configure any additional options required for the exploit. You can view these options by typing "show options" in the Metasploit console.

Finally, execute the exploit:

```
exploit
```

If successful, you should gain an elevated shell or Meterpreter session on the target system.

## 7. Demonstrate post-exploitation activities:

With the elevated shell or Meterpreter session, you can now demonstrate post-exploitation activities, such as gathering system information, executing commands, or exfiltrating data.

Remember to perform these demonstrations in a controlled environment and never use these techniques on systems or networks without proper authorization.
